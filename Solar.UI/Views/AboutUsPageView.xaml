What I've learned after talking to people around the world and communicating with both touring and recording artists, is that a lot of us share a similar vision about what a great guitar should be. Whether it's to help record that 'perfect' lead at home or in the studio, or to write the next great song, I want a guitar that takes me closer to that goal by inspiring me to become a better player and songwriter."/>
